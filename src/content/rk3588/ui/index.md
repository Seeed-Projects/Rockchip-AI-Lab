# User Interface Research

Our UI research focuses on creating intuitive and efficient interfaces for AI applications.

## Research Focus

### AI-Enhanced Interfaces
We design interfaces that leverage AI capabilities to provide more intuitive user experiences.

### Responsive Design
Our UIs are optimized to work across different devices powered by Rockchip processors.

### Performance Optimization
We focus on creating UIs that are lightweight and efficient, making the best use of available hardware resources.

## Hardware Integration

We design interfaces that leverage the capabilities of Rockchip processors like RK3588 and RK1820 to deliver exceptional user experiences.

The RK3588's powerful graphics processing capabilities enable rich, interactive UIs for AI applications.

The RK1820's efficiency allows for responsive UIs even in power-constrained environments.
