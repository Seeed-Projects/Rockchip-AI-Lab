# Visual Language Models

Our Visual Language Models research combines computer vision and natural language processing for multimodal AI applications.

## Research Areas

### Multimodal Understanding
We develop models that can understand and connect visual and textual information, optimized for Rockchip processors.

### Cross-Modal Learning
Our research focuses on techniques that enable models to learn from both visual and textual data simultaneously.

### Efficient Architectures
We design efficient architectures for VLMs that can run effectively on edge devices powered by Rockchip processors.

## Hardware Optimization

We develop efficient implementations that run effectively on Rockchip processors like RK3588 and RK1820.

The RK3588's combination of powerful CPU cores and dedicated AI processing units makes it ideal for complex VLM tasks that require both visual and language processing.

The RK1820's efficiency makes it suitable for lightweight VLM applications in resource-constrained environments.
